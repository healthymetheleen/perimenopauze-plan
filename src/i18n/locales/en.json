      "question": "What is cycle syncing?",
      "answer": "Cycle syncing means adjusting your nutrition, exercise, and activities to your cycle phase. Each phase (menstruation, follicular phase, ovulation, and luteal phase) has different hormonal characteristics. By taking this into account, you can perform better, have fewer symptoms, and optimize your energy levels. Our app gives you daily advice based on your cycle phase."
