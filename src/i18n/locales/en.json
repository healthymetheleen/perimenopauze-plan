      "question": "What is perimenopause?",
      "answer": "Perimenopause is the transitional period to menopause, which typically begins between your 40s and 50s. During this phase, your hormones fluctuate, which can lead to symptoms such as irregular periods, hot flashes, sleep problems, and mood swings. This period can last 4 to 10 years."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "What is cycle syncing?",
      "answer": "Cycle syncing means adjusting your nutrition, exercise, and activities to your cycle phase. Each phase (menstruation, follicular phase, ovulation, and luteal phase) has different hormonal characteristics. By taking this into account, you can perform better, have fewer symptoms, and optimize your energy levels. Our app gives you daily advice based on your cycle phase."

    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Who is this app for?",

    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "How does the AI analysis work?",
